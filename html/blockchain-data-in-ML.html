    <h1>Survey on Blockchain Data in Machine Learning</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This survey explores the integration of blockchain data into machine learning (ML), highlighting key implementation methods and use cases. The combination of these technologies enhances security, privacy, and trust in data-driven applications.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>2. Use of Blockchain Data in Machine Learning</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Decentralized and Collaborative AI Frameworks</h3>
        <p>Frameworks like Decentralized & Collaborative AI on Blockchain (DCAI) use the Ethereum blockchain to host and train ML models. They include incentive mechanisms to encourage high-quality data contributions and use data handlers to store data and metadata on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and transparency.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Machine Learning on Private Blockchain Data</h3>
        <p>Approaches leveraging blockchain for securely storing training data ensure the data has not been tampered with. Blockchain manages and validates transactions, providing a secure environment for decentralized ML, which is crucial where data privacy and trust are paramount.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Decentralized Deep Learning Architectures</h3>
        <p>Asynchronized Cooperative Decentralized Deep Learning allows contributors to train models on private data and share these models with cooperative applications. Models are fused using a learning-model fusion mechanism, with Ethereum providing processing power and data access. Security and privacy are enhanced using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-enabled encryption interfaces.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Clustering and Anomaly Detection in Blockchain Data</h3>
        <p>Unsupervised learning algorithms like k-means, PCA, and DBSCAN are applied to historical blockchain transaction data. For example, k-means clustering can identify clusters of potentially illegal transactions by comparing them to known blacklisted wallets.</p>

        <h3>2.5 Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Learning</h3>
        <p>The Learning Chain Framework applies a decentralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm with differential privacy to preserve user privacy. It involves local gradient computation and global gradient aggregation, ensuring sensitive data remains secure during collaborative model training on a blockchain network.</p>

        <h3>2.6 Healthcare Applications</h3>
        <p>Blockchain technology is used to securely share training data for ML models in healthcare, ensuring data integrity and privacy. This enables decentralized learning models to be trained on encrypted patient data, enhancing healthcare management systems by improving data security, interoperability, and predictive capabilities.</p>
