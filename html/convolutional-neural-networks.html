            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Historical Context</h2>
            <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks that have been particularly successful in the field of computer vision. They were inspired by the visual cortex in animals, where neurons respond to overlapping regions in the visual field, termed receptive fields.</p>
            <p>The concept of convolutional neural networks dates back to the 1980s with the work of Yann LeCun and others. LeCun's 1998 paper on the application of CNNs to handwritten digit recognition (LeNet-5) was a milestone in the field. This work demonstrated the practical utility of CNNs and set the stage for their widespread adoption.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Influences</h2>
            <p>CNNs have been influenced by several key ideas and technologies:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>Biological Inspiration:</strong> The architecture of CNNs is inspired by the structure of the animal visual cortex, where complex visual stimuli are processed in a hierarchical manner.</li>
                <li><strong>Multilayer Perceptrons:</strong> Early neural network models provided the foundation upon which CNNs were built, particularly in terms of understanding how to train deep networks using backpropagation.</li>
                <li><strong>Image Processing Techniques:</strong> Traditional image processing techniques, such as edge detection, have parallels in the convolutional filters used in CNNs.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Implications</h2>
            <p>CNNs have revolutionized several domains, most notably computer vision. They are now the backbone of many applications including:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>Image and Video Recognition:</strong> CNNs have significantly improved the accuracy of image classification and object detection tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Image Analysis:</strong> They are used for tasks such as tumor detection and classification in medical imaging.</li>
                <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles:</strong> CNNs are integral to the vision systems used in self-driving cars.</li>
                <li><strong>Facial Recognition:</strong> CNNs have enhanced the accuracy and reliability of facial recognition systems.</li>
            </ul>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">From CNNs to Transformer Neural Networks</h2>
                <p>While CNNs have been highly successful in processing visual data, the field of deep learning has continued to evolve. One of the most significant advancements in recent years has been the development of Transformer Neural Networks.</p>
                <p>Transformers were introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. Unlike CNNs, which rely on convolutional layers to process data, Transformers use a mechanism called self-attention to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data. This allows Transformers to capture long-range dependencies and relationships in the data more effectively.</p>
                <p>Transformers have been particularly transformative in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), leading to state-of-the-art models such as BERT, GPT, and T5. However, their impact is not limited to NLP. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that Transformers can also be highly effective for image classification tasks, challenging the dominance of CNNs in computer vision.</p>
                <p>As research continues, the boundaries between CNNs and Transformers are becoming increasingly blurred, with hybrid models combining the strengths of both architectures to achieve even greater performance in a variety of tasks.</p>
