            <h2>Key Concepts in Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>This lecture is dedicated to the core concepts that underpin the field of machine learning. We'll cover essential topics such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and the balancing act of bias and variance.</p>
            <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
            <p>Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline. We'll discuss techniques for cleaning, normalizing, and transforming data to prepare it for efficient learning.</p>
            <h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
            <p>Feature engineering is the art of selecting and constructing features that significantly improve model performance. We'll explore strategies for feature creation and selection.</p>
            <h3>Model Selection</h3>
            <p>Choosing the right model for a given problem is an art form. We'll consider the criteria that guide this decision, focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms.</p>
            <h3>Overfitting and Underfitting</h3>
            <p>We'll delve into the common issues of overfitting and underfitting, examining techniques to diagnose and address these problems to build robust models.</p>
