# Machine Learning Lectures Website

This repository hosts the web content and backend scripts for a series of educational lectures on Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The website aims to provide insightful lectures ranging from introductory topics to advanced discussions on ML techniques, including practical examples implemented through Python scripts.

## Features

- **Educational Content**: Detailed HTML pages for each lecture covering various topics in machine learning and AI.
- **Interactive Examples**: Use of Python scripts to demonstrate practical applications like generating dog names using bigrams.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be fully responsive, providing a good user experience across different devices.

## Repository Structure

- `/scripts`: Python scripts that demonstrate machine learning concepts, such as the bigram name generator.
- `/styles`: CSS files for styling the website.
- `/images`: Directory containing all images used in the lectures.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and guidance on how to use it.

## Installation

To get the website running locally or deploy it:
