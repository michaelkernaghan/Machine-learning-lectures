            <h2>Machine Learning and Large Language Models</h2>
            <p>Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have a significant and intrinsic relationship where ML serves as the foundational technology enabling the development and functioning of LLMs.</p>
            <h3>Machine Learning: The Foundation</h3>
            <p>Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to recognize patterns, make decisions, and predictions based on data. The ML paradigm shifts from explicitly programming rules to creating algorithms that can learn from and make decisions based on data.</p>
            <h3>Large Language Models: A Specialization within ML</h3>
            <p>Large Language Models like GPT (from OpenAI), BERT (developed by Google), and others, are specific applications of machine learning focused on processing and understanding natural language. LLMs are trained using deep learning, a subset of machine learning, on vast amounts of text data. This training involves the following ML concepts and methodologies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Most LLMs initially rely on supervised learning where the model is trained on labeled datasets.</li>
                <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Some aspects of LLM training involve unsupervised learning where models try to make sense of data without explicit labels.</li>
                <li><strong>Neural Networks and Deep Learning:</strong> LLMs are built using large neural networks, particularly transformer architectures.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Relationships and Applications</h3>
            <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP): LLMs are a cornerstone of modern NLP, enabling applications from machine translation and summarization to question-answering and sentiment analysis. They represent a shift towards more general and powerful language understanding capabilities compared to earlier models.</p>
            <p>Transfer Learning: LLMs are often pre-trained on general tasks and then fine-tuned for specific applications. This is an example of transfer learning, where a model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.</p>
            <p>Scaling and Performance: The performance of language models generally improves with an increasing amount of training data and model size, highlighting ML principles like feature representation and model capacity.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Differences Between AI and ML</h3>
            <p>While AI is a broader concept concerning creating machines capable of performing tasks that seem intelligent, ML is a specific subset of AI that trains a machine how to learn. ML is one way to achieve AI.</p>
