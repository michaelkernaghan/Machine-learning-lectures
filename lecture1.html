            <h2>Machine Learning and Large Language Models</h2>
            <p>Machine Learning (ML) is the foundation for Large Language Models (LLMs). ML involves training algorithms
                to recognize patterns and make decisions based on data.</p>

            <h3>Machine Learning: The Foundation</h3>
            <p>ML trains algorithms to learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed.</p>

            <h3>Large Language Models: A Specialization within ML</h3>
            <p>LLMs like GPT and BERT specialize in processing and understanding natural language through deep learning
                on vast text datasets. Key ML concepts in LLMs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Training on labeled datasets.</li>
                <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Making sense of data without explicit labels.</li>
                <li><strong>Neural Networks and Deep Learning:</strong> Using large neural networks, particularly
                    transformer architectures.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Relationships and Applications</h3>
            <p>LLMs are central to modern NLP, enabling applications like translation, summarization, and sentiment
                analysis. They use transfer learning for fine-tuning and demonstrate improved performance with larger
                datasets and models.</p>

            <h1>Everyday Life Encounters with Embedded Machine Learning and Deep Learning Technologies</h1>
            <p>In today's digital age, machine learning, deep learning, and large language models are integral to a vast
                array of technologies that people encounter every day. These technologies have been seamlessly
                integrated into products and services across various industries, enhancing user experiences and
                providing personalized content. Here are some common examples that many people interact with on a daily
                basis:</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Recommendation Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Netflix, Spotify, Amazon.</p>
            <img src="./images/recommendation-systems.png" alt="Recommendation Systems" class="section-image">
            <p><strong>Technology:</strong> These platforms use collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and
                increasingly deep learning techniques to recommend products or media. They analyze past user behavior
                alongside large datasets of similar decisions made by other users to predict what the user might like
                next. Collaborative filtering leverages the preferences of similar users, while content-based filtering
                focuses on the attributes of items the user has interacted with.</p>
            <p>Deep learning enhances these traditional methods by capturing complex patterns in user behavior and item
                attributes. For instance, Netflix may suggest movies based on genres you've watched before, leveraging a
                mix of collaborative and content-based filtering. Additionally, deep learning models analyze viewing
                habits, user interactions, and even textual descriptions to provide more accurate recommendations.
                Similarly, Spotify recommends songs by analyzing listening habits, user-created playlists, and audio
                features such as tempo and rhythm.</p>
