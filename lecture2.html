            <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>In this lecture, we'll explore the different types of machine learning and understand their unique characteristics and applications. Machine learning can broadly be classified into three types: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.</p>
            <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
            <p>This type of learning involves a labeled dataset to 'teach' or 'supervise' the model. It includes tasks such as classification and regression. We'll look at how algorithms like linear regression and decision trees operate with labeled data.</p>
            <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
            <p>Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, works with unlabeled data. Here, the model tries to identify patterns on its own. We'll study techniques like clustering and association, which are fundamental to unsupervised learning.</p>
            <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
            <p>Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving feedback. This feedback is often in the form of rewards or penalties, shaping the learning process through trial and error.</p>
