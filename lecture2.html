            <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>In this lecture, we'll explore the different types of machine learning and understand their unique characteristics and applications. Machine learning can broadly be classified into three types: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.</p>
            <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
            <p>This type of learning involves a labeled dataset to 'teach' or 'supervise' the model. It includes tasks such as classification and regression. We'll look at how algorithms like linear regression and decision trees operate with labeled data.</p>
            <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
            <p>Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, works with unlabeled data. Here, the model tries to identify patterns on its own. We'll study techniques like clustering and association, which are fundamental to unsupervised learning.</p>
            <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
            <p>Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving feedback. This feedback is often in the form of rewards or penalties, shaping the learning process through trial and error.</p>
            <h3>Relationship with Large Language Models</h3><!-- Additional content would follow here for other chapters -->
            <p>Transformers and their associated technologies primarily rely on supervised and semi-supervised learning paradigms due to their effectiveness in leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to learn complex representations of language.<p>
            <p>Unsupervised methods are also crucial, particularly in the pre-training stages of model development, where the aim is to capture broad linguistic patterns from large datasets without specific task-oriented labels. <p>
            <p>Reinforcement learning, while less common in traditional NLP tasks, is gaining traction in interactive and real-time application scenarios involving LLMs. Graph Attention Networks, being versatile, can operate across different learning paradigms depending on the specific application and the available data.</p>
